# Spread-good
Destiny cookie type website

## The folder contains front-end and back-end files, to start the website:
1. Go to 'my-app' inside "Frontend" folder, type "npm start" inside the terminal;
2. Go to "Backend" folder, type "node app.js" inside the terminal.

## How does it work?
* You can press the "Cookie" button to get your destiny for the day,
* You can suggest your destiny for someone else to get it by clicking "Click to add" button,
* just fill the form and click "Submit".

# My purpose by working on that website was to spread good thoughts and make people feel better.


note for Saar: the post axios does'nt pass any information to the database, I couldn't solve this issue alone...
